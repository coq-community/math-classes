Lemma not_symmetry `{Symmetric A R} (x y: A): ¬R x y → ¬R y x.
Proof. firstorder. Qed.
(* Also see Coq bug #2358. A totally different approach would be to define negated relations
    such as inequality as separate relations rather than notations, so that the existing [symmetry]
    will work for them. However, this most likely breaks other things. *)

Proof. intros ? ?. apply biinduction; [solve_proper | easy | firstorder]. Qed.
