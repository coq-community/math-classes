  (* The initial object will consists of arity-0 terms with a congruence incorporating the variety's laws.
   For this we simply take universal_algebra's Term type, but exclude variables by taking False
   as the variable index type: *)

  Let ClosedTerm := (Term et False).
  Let ClosedTerm0 a := ClosedTerm (ne_list.one a).

  (* Operations are implemented as App-tree builders, so that [o a b] yields [App (App (Op o) a) b]. *)

  (* While this fancy congruence is the one we'll use to make our initial object a setoid,

   on closed terms: *)

  (* To show its initiality, we begin by constructing arrows to arbitrary other objects: *)

    Definition morph a: the_object a → other a := eval_in_other.

    (* Given an assignment mapping variables to closed terms of arity 0, we can now
     evaluate open terms in the other model in two ways: by first closing it and then
     evaluating the closed term using eval_in_other, or by evaluating it directly but
     with variable lookup implemented in terms of eval_in_other. We now show that
     these two ways yield the same result, thanks to proper-ness of the algebra's
     operations: *)

  (* Todo: Show decidability of equality (likely quite tricky). Without that, we cannot use any of this to

     groups. In particular, a group presentation determines a variety, the initial object of which is the
     group so presented. *)
