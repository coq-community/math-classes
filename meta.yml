  A library of abstract interfaces for mathematical structures in Coq

description: |
  Math classes is a library of abstract interfaces for mathematical
  structures, such as:

  *  Algebraic hierarchy (groups, rings, fields, …)
  *  Relations, orders, …
  *  Categories, functors, universal algebra, …
  *  Numbers: N, Z, Q, …
  *  Operations, (shift, power, abs, …)

  It is heavily based on Coq’s new type classes in order to provide:
  structure inference, multiple inheritance/sharing, convenient
  algebraic manipulation (e.g. rewriting) and idiomatic use of
  notations.

  ## Building and installation instructions

  The easiest way to install the latest released version of Math Classes
  is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
  opam install coq-math-classes
  ```

  To instead build and install manually, do:

  ``` shell
  git clone https://github.com/coq-community/math-classes.git
  cd math-classes
  ./configure.sh
  make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
  make install
  ```

  ## Directory structure

  ### categories/
  Proofs that certain structures form categories.

  ### functors/

  ### interfaces/
  Definitions of abstract interfaces/structures.

  ### implementations/
  Definitions of concrete data structures and algorithms, and proofs that they are instances of certain structures (i.e. implement certain interfaces).

  ### misc/
  Miscellaneous things.

  ### orders/
  Theory about orders on different structures.

  ### quote/
  Prototype implementation of type class based quoting. To be integrated.

  ### theory/
  Proofs of properties of structures.

  ### varieties/
  Proofs that certain structures are varieties, and translation to/from type classes dedicated to these structures (defined in interfaces/).

  The reason we treat categories and varieties differently from other structures
  (like groups and rings) is that they are like meta-interfaces whose implementations
  are not concrete data structures and algorithms but are themselves abstract structures.

  To be able to distinguish the various arrows, we recommend using a variable width font.
